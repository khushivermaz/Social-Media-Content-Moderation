# Social Media Content Moderation Using Unsupervised Learning  

This project focuses on developing an unsupervised learning model to moderate social media content by analyzing the sentiment of tweets. It leverages the **Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset**, applying clustering techniques to identify patterns in user sentiment without labeled data. The model helps classify content for potential moderation, enhancing the quality of discussions on social platforms.

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning to identify and moderate harmful or inappropriate content on social media platforms. Sentiment clustering can group similar sentiments together, enabling the detection of outliers or potentially toxic content that may need moderation.  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset used in this project is from the **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** dataset, containing the following columns:  

- **Training Set**:  
  - `textID`: Unique identifier for each tweet.  
  - `text`: The content of the tweet.  
  - `selected_text`: Extracted text that highlights the sentiment.  
  - `sentiment`: Sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral).  

- **Test Set**:  
  - `textID`: Unique identifier for each tweet.  
  - `text`: The content of the tweet.  
  - `sentiment`: Sentiment category (used for validation).  

## Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Text cleaning (removing URLs, special characters, and stop words).  
   - Tokenization and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.  

2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   - Creating word vectors to represent textual data.  
   - Dimensionality reduction using PCA or t-SNE for visualization.  

3. **Unsupervised Learning**:  
   - Applying clustering algorithms such as K-means or DBSCAN to group similar sentiments.  
   - Identifying clusters that may indicate potentially harmful content.  

4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Comparing cluster outputs to the `sentiment` column for validation.  
   - Analyzing coherence of clusters for effective moderation insights.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - NLTK / SpaCy  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (if deep learning is used)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/social-media-moderation  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd social-media-moderation  
   ```  

3. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## Usage  
1. **Run the preprocessing script** to clean the data:  
   ```bash  
   python preprocess.py  
   ```  

2. **Train the model** using the clustering algorithm:  
   ```bash  
   python train_model.py  
   ```  

3. **Visualize the clusters** and results:  
   ```bash  
   python visualize_clusters.py  
   ```  

## Results  
The model successfully groups tweets into sentiment-based clusters, revealing patterns that can assist in identifying potentially harmful content. Visualizations of the clusters illustrate the separation of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.  

## Future Work  
- Incorporate deep learning techniques like autoencoders for better feature extraction.  
- Implement real-time tweet monitoring for dynamic moderation.  
- Explore integration with social media platforms via APIs for automated moderation.
